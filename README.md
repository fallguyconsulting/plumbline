# Plumbline

**Code that runs true under agentic maintenance.**

Plumbline is a methodology for writing code that AI coding agents can safely maintain in parallel, across model generations, and at scale. It packages as a Claude Code plugin that installs the project rules into any consuming codebase, with lint tooling to follow.

## Install

This repository is its own single-plugin marketplace (the catalog lives at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under the marketplace name `fallguy`). In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add fallguyconsulting/plumbline
/plugin install plumbline@fallguy
```

## Quick start

In any project:

```
/plumbline:affirm
```

This writes `.claude/rules/plumbline-cheatsheet.md` into the current project — the rules file every Claude Code session in the project will read. Commit it. Re-run `/plumbline:affirm` after a plugin upgrade to pick up the latest canonical cheatsheet.

With the plugin installed, the `PostToolUse` hook runs `plumbline` on every Edit/Write automatically and blocks (exit 2) when violations are found, so the agent sees the message and fixes in the same turn.

## Documents

- [docs/plumbline-manifesto.md](docs/plumbline-manifesto.md) — the philosophy: why agentic maintenance needs different design priorities and the cost model the methodology serves.
- [docs/plumbline-style-guide.md](docs/plumbline-style-guide.md) — the actionable rules: how to write Plumbline code, examples, the comment rule, and a PR checklist.
- [docs/plumbline-cheatsheet.md](docs/plumbline-cheatsheet.md) — the compact form materialized into consuming projects by `/plumbline:affirm`.
- [docs/plumbline-porting-guide.md](docs/plumbline-porting-guide.md) — the migration arc for adopting Plumbline on an existing codebase. Phase-by-phase, tool sequencing, decision points, plan template. Consume directly or via `/plumbline:port` (emits a project-specific plan with backlog numbers filled in).

## The rule on comments

Plumbline's central comment rule is strict: **code is the documentation; comments are not permitted in source files** except three structural exemptions:

1. **Machine directives** — license headers (SPDX, Copyright, Licensed under), lint suppressions (`eslint-disable`, `ts-ignore`, `noqa`, `pylint:`, `nolint`, etc.), build tags (`go:`), generated-file markers, shebangs.
2. **Configured citation tags** — declared in `.plumbline.json`'s `citations` array. Each entry pairs a tag with a structural resolution rule (a `file_template` containing `{slug}`, or an `appears_in_glob`). A comment using the tag is allowed only when its slug resolves per the rule. Plumbline ships zero default citation tags; projects declare them.
3. **Documentation comments** — JSDoc/GoDoc adjacent to declarations, only in files carrying the opt-in marker `// @plumbline:allow-docstrings` (or `# ...` for hash-comment languages).

Everything else is residue. The default action for any comment-hygiene violation is **delete**. Load-bearing information — a constraint, a deliberate-choice guard, a named invariant — belongs in code: an assertion with a message, a test whose name carries the rule, a type that enforces the shape. Comments are the wrong layer for any of it.

## Lineage

Plumbline grew out of the Cold Read methodology. Cold Read v1 optimized for AI agents whose binding constraint was comprehension; v2 reweighted around verification. Plumbline v1 took Cold Read v2's content forward under a name that describes the goal — code that runs true. Plumbline v0.2 added the lint binary with a tag-vocabulary comment-hygiene check. v0.4 (this document) replaces the tag vocabulary with the strict no-comments rule and the structural citation-config exemption: experience showed the tag vocabulary was a judgment-call seam that agents reliably routed around. The new rule has only structural exemptions.

## Subcommands

The `plumbline` binary is a multi-tool CLI. The default (no subcommand) is the lint:

```
plumbline                              # lint cwd
plumbline <path>                       # lint a path
plumbline patterns [path]              # cluster violations by shape
plumbline budget save|check [path]     # ratchet baseline
plumbline suggest [path]               # propose per-violation fixes
plumbline slug "<prose>"               # generate a kebab-case slug
plumbline starter [path]               # generate a starter .plumbline.json
plumbline doctor [path]                # diagnose installation
plumbline explain [<topic>]            # show docs for a check or config concept
plumbline ci github|gitlab|pre-commit  # emit a CI workflow
```

Each subcommand is also wrapped as a Claude Code skill: `/plumbline:patterns`, `/plumbline:budget`, and so on.

## Lint, config, and CI

The lint binary lives at `bin/plumbline` (Node.js, no build step). Invoke it directly:

```
node /path/to/plumbline-plugin/bin/plumbline [path]
```

Or from a hooked Claude Code session, it runs automatically after every Edit/Write.

Project config lives in `.plumbline.json` at the repo root (optional):

```json
{
  "citations": [
    { "tag": "@concept:",  "file_template": ".ok-planner/design/concepts/{slug}.md" },
    { "tag": "@story:",    "file_template": ".ok-planner/design/stories/{slug}.md" },
    { "tag": "@decision:", "file_template": ".ok-planner/design/decisions/{slug}.md" }
  ],
  "ignore": ["generated/", "test/fixtures/"],
  "checks": {
    "comment_hygiene": true,
    "citation_resolution": true
  }
}
```

`citations` is the only way to declare project-specific allowed comment forms; each entry must pair a tag with a structural resolution rule. `/plumbline:starter` produces a project-shaped config (including the ok-planner citation entries above when it detects `.ok-planner/`).

For CI, run `node bin/plumbline .` from the project root and treat any non-zero exit as a failure.
